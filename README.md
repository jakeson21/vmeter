Digital voltmeter circuit design based on an ICL7107

# Description
This circuit is centered around the ICL7107, a single-chip digital voltmeter with features an integrated 3.1 7-segment LED display driver. MY purpose designing and building this was to use it in my homemade bench top power supply as a readout for the (-)12V-0V and 0V-12V variable supplies. The first iteration used all through hole components. This design uses mostly surface mount components.
